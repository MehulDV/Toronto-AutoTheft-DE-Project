## Introduction

The Auto Theft Open Data is part of Toronto Police Service's initiative to provide accessible data to the public. The dataset covers reported auto theft incidents across Toronto. This data can be used for analysis, visualization, and building models to identify trends and hotspots of auto theft in the city.

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: [Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::auto-theft-open-data/about)
- **Data Format**: CSV, GeoJSON
- **Frequency**: Updated regularly
- **Data Fields**:
  - `Occurrence Date`: Date and time of the theft
  - `Neighbourhood`: Toronto neighborhood where the theft occurred
  - `Latitude` and `Longitude`: Coordinates of the incident
  - Other relevant fields about the incident

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:
- Data analysis and visualization of auto theft trends in Toronto.
- Building predictive models to anticipate areas with high risks of auto theft.
- Community awareness initiatives and public safety campaigns.

## Code Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the Spark code with the Auto Theft Open Data:

### 1. Loading and Saving the Dataset

The following code demonstrates how to load the dataset from a CSV file, display it, and save it as a Parquet file:

```scala
val df = spark.read.format("csv")
  .option("header", "true")
  .option("inferschema", "true")
  .load("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/Auto_Theft_Open_Data.csv")
df.show()

df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/output/Auto_Theft_Open_Data.parquet")
```

### 2. Auto Thefts Trend by Year
This query counts the total number of auto thefts reported in the dataset:

```scala
val total_AutoTheft_Count = spark.sql("SELECT count(*) FROM Auto_Theft_Open_Data")
total_AutoTheft_Count.show()
```

## Installation

To access the data:

1. **Download the dataset** from the [Toronto Police Open Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::auto-theft-open-data/about).
2. Load the dataset into your preferred analysis tool (e.g., Python, Scala, Spark, R).
